# Bootstrap Portfolio

### Overview
    My portfolio provides information on myself, who I am, what I like to do, and a way to contact me. I made this portfolio in order to practice bootstrap, HTML, and CSS. To access my portfolio, you will only need a link, which can be found in the "Deployed" section of this ReadMe.
